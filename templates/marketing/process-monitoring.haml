          %p `pgrep` is a command that lets you find a currently running process' pid by regular expression.
          %p With dxdt, you can use regular expressions to search through all of your currently running processes and all of the processes that have terminated in the last 4 weeks.  Then, you can click on the name of the process and see its detailed performance history.
