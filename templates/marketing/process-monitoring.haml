            is a command that lets you find the pid for a currently running process by regular expression.
          %p With dxdt, you can use regular expressions to search through all of your currently running processes and all of the processes that have terminated in the last 4 weeks.
          %p Click on the name of a process and you'll see its detailed performance history. You can drill down, compare, and annotate graphs for the <b>fastest</b> root cause analysis.
