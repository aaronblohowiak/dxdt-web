          %h2 Every Process and Port
          %p 
            Just by installing the script, we start monitoring every
            %a(href="/process-monitoring")> process
            and
            %a(href="/port-monitoring")> port.
            You don't have to worry about installing any plugins or changing things as you add more services to a machine; all new services will be picked up automatically.
          %h2(style="margin-top:18px") Automatic API Keys &amp; Security Tokens!
          %p The command you paste into your server downloads a script that is customized for your account and environment.
          %p It includes an API Key and a Security Token <i>inside</i> the script so there is nothing to configure.
